Spanish studying helper app




In order to make any changes to the used datasheets, one has to change the code in the word_scraping script.
For the purpose of using the app in its current state, files from Datasheets folder are required. 
Directory of datasheets is automatically assigned

The app is working but the code isn't polished/formatted efficiently, will be eventually updated
edit: lmao no it wont
